    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age; // ag2 has the value of age (100)
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // age = 200, age2 = 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name; // name2 has the value of name (is not a referance to name)
    console.log(name, name2); // name, name2 = 'Wes'
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // name = 'wesley', name2='Wes'


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // team is a REFERANCE to players array

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // Edits  players Array
    console.log(players, team); // OUTPUT: ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team4, players); // OUTPUT: ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // Another Method:
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captin = person; // Captin is a referance not a copy of person object
    captain.number = 99; // Editing the person object
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // A Shallow Copy i.e only 1 level deep
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99}) // Last argument is the values you want to change in given object, 
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}; // A Shallow Copy i.e only 1 level deep

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // A Poor Man's Deep Clone
